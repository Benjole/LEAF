## Getting the code

Getting the LEAF code is easy, there is a script that takes care of everything for you. It will set up LEAF and a CMSSW version in the directory the script is executed from. You will need access to /cvmfs in order for the compilation to work.
To set get LEAF, do:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reimersa/LEAF/master/get_leaf.sh
    source get_leaf.sh
